# Configuration

The `<PopprModal />` component is the core UI renderer behind every modal triggered via the `poppr()` API. You **must** render it once in your app â€” typically in your layout file.

---

## âœ… How to use

```tsx
import { PopprModal } from "poppr";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <PopprModal />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Once rendered, you can call `poppr()` from anywhere in your app â€” the modal will appear globally.

## ðŸ“¦ Props

Currently, `<PopprModal />` does not require any props. All state is internally managed by the poppr store, and configuration is passed via the `poppr()` function.

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon

The following features will be supported directly via `<PopprModal />` props in upcoming versions:

- **Positioning**: Control where the modal appears (top, center, bottom).
- **Theme overrides**: Inject dark/light styles or custom class mappings.
- **Global options**: Set default modal behavior app-wide (e.g., closeOnBackdropClick, durations, etc.).

## ðŸ§  Tip

Even though `<PopprModal />` is simple, it powers all the advanced functionality under the hood like:

- Stacking multiple modals
- Confirm + loading flows
- Type-based styling and icons
- Animated mounts using Framer Motion

## ðŸ›  Best Practice

Place it as low in your layout tree as possible to avoid hydration issues and ensure it's only rendered once.
